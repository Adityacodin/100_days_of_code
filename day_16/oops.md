 - for an object there are only two things which matter : what it "has" and what it "does"

 'has' here means the attributes
 'does' here means the methods or the functions

- For a Waiter :
 what it has :
    is_holding_plate = True
    tables_responsible = [4,5,6]

what it does :
    def take_order(table,order):
        ...
    
    def take_payment(amount):
        ...
    
    def serve(order):
        ...

- a blueprint of an object is what we call a 'class'
