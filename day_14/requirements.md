# to do

- store info of musicians in a dictionary where their name,place is the key and the follower count is the value 

- initialize a variable user_selection which will hold the value the user will select (A or B)

- encapsulate the dictionary work in a function which will have user-selection as input

- the function will return true or false based on the user selection : 
it will compare the follower count of both a  and b and if for instance a has greater value and the user_selection is also a then return true else false and vicaversa
